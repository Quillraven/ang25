# Masamune Angular UI

![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-19.2.9-purple?logo=angular)

This UI is for my 2D Retro RPG game called [Masamune](https://github.com/Quillraven/Masamune).

It is hosted as a [GitHub Page](https://quillraven.github.io/masamune-ang/) and contains following routes:
- Home
- Enemies
- Items
- Actions

It was developed together with Jetbrain's [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/junie/) Agent.
